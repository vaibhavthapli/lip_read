# LipSense
"A smart and inituitive lip-reading assistant."
## Overview
The **Lip Read Model** is an advanced machine learning system designed for lip-reading applications, leveraging OpenCV, TensorFlow, and other essential libraries. This project aims to enhance communication accessibility, particularly for individuals with hearing impairments, by accurately interpreting lip movements.

## Features
- **Real-time Lip Movement Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV for efficient lip tracking and feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning-Based Prediction**: Implements deep learning models with TensorFlow for precise classification.
- **Comprehensive Data Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib for in-depth analysis and visualization of lip movement patterns.
- **Dataset Preprocessing**: Employs ImageIO for effective handling and processing of image sequences.
- **Robust Training and Evaluation**: Supports model training, fine-tuning, and performance assessment.
- **Web-Based Deployment**: Deploys the model using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

## Installation
To set up the required environment, install the necessary dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib imageio gdown tensorflow streamlit
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation can be accessed via the link below:

To download the dataset using `gdown`, run:

```bash
gdown --id 1YlvpDLix3S-U8fd-gqRwPcWXAXm8JwjL
```

## Usage
To execute the model, run the following command:

```bash
python lip_read.py
```

To deploy the model using Streamlit, run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
